        Hailing from the beautiful state of Kentucky, I have dedicated 15 years of my career to higher education. Over this period, my journey has seen me wear many hats, but a particularly transformative experience has been my foray into the world of data analysis. This wasn't a formal classroom education, but rather a practical, on-the-job learning experience. I found myself working with large financial files and intricate datasets, diving deep into the nuances of data to derive meaningful insights. This hands-on experience, coupled with my rich professional background, has equipped me with a unique perspective and a diverse skill set.
